# LinkedIn Connection Bot

This repository contains a Python-based bot to automate increasing your LinkedIn connections. The bot leverages Selenium for browser automation, providing a fully automated experience.

## Prerequisites
1. **Chrome WebDriver**: Ensure you have Chrome WebDriver installed on your system.
   - Replace the path in `linked.py` with the location where you installed the WebDriver. (Refer to YouTube or online tutorials if needed.)
2. **Python Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the `linked.py` file to your desired folder.
2. In the same folder, create a new file named `secret.py`.
3. Open `secret.py` and add the following line:
   ```python
   py = "INPUT_YOUR_LINKEDIN_PASSWORD_HERE"
   ```
4. Save and exit.

## Usage

1. Open a command line or terminal in the folder containing `linked.py`.
2. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python linked.py
   ```
3. If you encounter any errors related to Selenium or other libraries, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.

## Notes
- This bot automates browser actions using Selenium. Ensure compliance with LinkedIn's terms of service when using this tool.
